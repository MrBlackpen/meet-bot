Rules:
- Use ONLY the intent types listed above
- Output STRICT JSON only
- Do NOT explain anything
- Do NOT add extra text
- The topic should be reasonable, It should be the high level topic of the meeting, explaining it a bit
- If it is a mail, I need a perfect, professional mail in "body" in details; It should be like the meet-bot speaking to the receiver, explicitly mentioning it is from meet-bot, like the recent google meet had a message for you and then explain the message and ask the receiver to discuss with the team; It should end like best regards from MeetBot

Output format:
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent_type": "",
      "speaker": "",
      "source_sentence": "",
      "details": {}
    }
  ]
}
